# Comprehensive Analytics Guide

## Overview

The chatbot can now analyze comprehensive process mining metrics from pre-aggregated data tables **without displaying charts**. All responses are text-based insights and analysis.

## How It Works

The system reads pre-computed analytics from CSV files in the `mnt/data/aggregates/` folder and provides text-based insights when you ask questions about:

- **Case Aging**: How long cases have been open
- **Flow Efficiency**: Ratio of value-add time to total time
- **Team Handoffs**: Number of transitions between teams
- **User Interactions**: Mouse clicks, keypresses, copy/paste patterns
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: Combined analysis across all metrics

## Example Queries

### Case Aging Analysis
```
User: "What is the case aging distribution?"

Chatbot Response:
Case Aging Analysis for Salesforce:
• Total cases analyzed: 1,234
• Cases aged 0-1 days: 456 (37.0%)
• Cases aged 1-3 days: 321 (26.0%)
• Cases aged 3-7 days: 234 (19.0%)
• Cases aged 7-14 days: 156 (12.6%)
• Cases aged >14 days: 67 (5.4%)

Key Insight: 67 cases (5.4%) are over 14 days old, which may indicate bottlenecks or stalled processes.
```

### Flow Efficiency Report
```
User: "What's our flow efficiency?"

Chatbot Response:
Flow Efficiency Analysis for Salesforce:
• Total touch time: 1,234.5 minutes (20.6 hours)
• Total wait time: 5,678.2 minutes (94.6 hours)
• Flow efficiency: 17.9%

Interpretation:
- Flow efficiency shows the ratio of value-add time to total time
- Current efficiency of 17.9% means 82.1% of time is spent waiting
- Industry benchmark for good flow efficiency is typically 15-25%
- Your current rate is within industry benchmarks
```

### Team Handoff Analysis
```
User: "How many handoffs occur between teams?"

Chatbot Response:
Team Handoff Analysis for Salesforce:
• Average handoffs per case: 2.3
• Maximum handoffs in a single case: 7
• Cases with 0 handoffs: 234 (23.4%)
• Cases with 3+ handoffs: 189 (18.9%)

Key Insight: Each handoff adds coordination overhead and potential delays. Cases with multiple handoffs may benefit from process redesign or better team coordination.
```

### Interaction Patterns
```
User: "What are the interaction patterns by team?"

Chatbot Response:
Interaction Analysis for Salesforce Teams:
• Total mouse clicks: 45,678
• Total keypresses: 123,456
• Total copy operations: 2,345
• Total paste operations: 2,234
• Average effort rate: 23.4 interactions/minute

Input Mix:
• Clicks: 26.4%
• Keypresses: 71.3%
• Copy/Paste: 2.3%

Key Insight: High copy/paste rates (2.3%) may indicate manual data entry that could be automated.
```

### Comprehensive Summary
```
User: "Give me a comprehensive summary"

Chatbot Response:
=== Comprehensive Analytics Summary for Salesforce ===

1. CASE AGING:
[Full case aging analysis]

2. FLOW EFFICIENCY:
[Full flow efficiency report]

3. TEAM HANDOFFS:
[Full handoff analysis]

4. USER INTERACTIONS:
[Full interaction analysis]
```

## Supported Queries

### Query Keywords

The chatbot recognizes these keywords for comprehensive analytics:

- **Case Aging**: "aging", "age", "old", "stale"
- **Flow Efficiency**: "flow", "efficiency", "touch", "wait"
- **Handoffs**: "handoff", "handoffs", "transition", "transfer"
- **Interactions**: "interaction", "clicks", "keys", "effort", "mouse", "keyboard"
- **Summary**: "comprehensive", "complete", "all", "everything", "summary"

### Natural Language Examples

You can ask in natural language:
- "Show me the case aging analysis"
- "What's the flow efficiency for Salesforce?"
- "How many team handoffs are happening?"
- "What are the interaction patterns?"
- "Give me resource-level interaction data"
- "Show comprehensive analytics"

## Data Requirements

### Expected Directory Structure

```
mnt/data/aggregates/
├── salesforce/
│   ├── sf_case_timeline_gantt.csv
│   ├── sf_case_stage_stack.csv
│   ├── sf_case_wait_touch_waterfall.csv
│   ├── sf_input_mix_by_team.csv
│   ├── sf_effort_rate_by_team.csv
│   ├── sf_resource_effort_leaderboard.csv
│   └── ... (other aggregate files)
└── amadeus/
    ├── ama_case_timeline_gantt.csv
    ├── ama_case_stage_stack.csv
    ├── ama_case_wait_touch_waterfall.csv
    ├── ama_input_mix_by_activity.csv
    └── ... (other aggregate files)
```

### If Data Is Missing

If the aggregate files are not present, the chatbot will respond with:
```
"Case aging data not available for salesforce."
```

You can still use all the regular chatbot features (summaries, bottlenecks, team performance, etc.)

## Integration with Existing Features

The comprehensive analytics **supplements** existing features:

### Regular Queries Still Work
- "summary" - Basic dataset summary
- "top bottlenecks" - Activity bottleneck analysis  
- "team performance" - Team comparison charts
- "recommendations" - Managerial recommendations

### Comprehensive Analytics Adds
- Deep-dive aging analysis
- Precise flow efficiency metrics
- Detailed handoff tracking
- Interaction pattern insights

## Help Command

Type "help" to see all available commands including the new analytics:

```
User: "help"

Chatbot Response:
You can ask for things like:
  - 'summary'
  - 'top bottlenecks'
  - 'team performance'
  - 'app usage'
  - 'recommendations for managers'
  - 'who is the most active user?'
  - 'how many users are there?'
  - 'give me insights about the data'

Advanced Analytics:
  - 'case aging analysis'

  - 'team handoff analysis'
  - 'interaction patterns'
  - 'comprehensive summary'
```

## Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
CreativeDataChatBot.handle_smart_query()
    ↓
Detects: "aging", "flow efficiency", etc.
    ↓
SalesforceAgent.handle() OR AmadeusAgent.handle()
    ↓
ComprehensiveAnalyticsReader.query_analytics()
    ↓
Loads: mnt/data/aggregates/{dataset}/{file}.csv
    ↓
Computes: Metrics, percentages, insights
    ↓
Returns: Text-based response with interpretation
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable

The feature auto-detects if comprehensive analytics are available:

```python
# In main.py
COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYTICS_AVAILABLE = True  # Auto-detected
```

If the `mnt/data/aggregates/` folder doesn't exist, the feature gracefully degrades.

### Customization

You can customize responses in `backend/comprehensive_analytics.py`:

- Modify metric thresholds
- Add new analysis types
- Change interpretation text
- Add industry benchmarks

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Comprehensive analytics not available"

**Solution**: Ensure the aggregate CSV files exist in `mnt/data/aggregates/salesforce/` or `mnt/data/aggregates/amadeus/`

### Issue: "Case aging data not available"

**Solution**: Check that the specific aggregate file exists (e.g., `sf_case_stage_stack.csv`)

### Issue: Analytics responses are empty

**Solution**: Verify CSV files have data and correct column names

## Performance

- **Query Time**: < 100ms (reads from pre-aggregated CSVs)
- **Memory**: Minimal (loads only requested aggregates)
- **Latency**: No model calls required (deterministic)

## Examples by Dataset

### Salesforce Queries
- "What is the case aging for Salesforce?"
- "Show Salesforce flow efficiency"
- "Salesforce team handoff report"
- "Interaction patterns for Salesforce teams"

### Amadeus Queries
